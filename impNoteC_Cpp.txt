NOTE: (Important)
When you compile C++ code, you should use g++, which is specifically designed for C++. The gcc compiler is primarily for C code and does not automatically link against the C++ standard libraries. As a result, when you try to use C++ features like std::cout, the linker fails to find the necessary definitions, leading to the "undefined reference" errors

----------------------------------------------
To run executed file:
    > .\fileName.extension

    For example - .\twoProject.exe
----------------------------------------------

    -- For C++ Only --
1. To compile C++ code:
    > g++ fileName.extension

2. To compile and output an executable file.
    > g++ fileName.extension -o fileName

For example - To compile 'twoProject.cpp' and outout an executable named 'twoProject'.
    > g++ twoProject.cpp -o twoProject

   -- For C Only --
1. To compile C code:
    > gcc fileName.extension

2. To compile and output an executable file.
    > gcc fileName.extension -o fileName

For example - To compile 'twoProject.c' and outout an executable named 'twoProject'.
    > gcc twoProject.c -o twoProject
